# European Parties 2017 II

Since 1999 researchers from The University of North Carolina estimate party positions on European integration, ideology and policy issues for national parties in a variety of European countries through experts surveys. For this project, I am going to use the most recent one, the 2017 Chapel Hill Expert FLASH Survey (CHES). According to its website, this is a reduced survey that focuses on a smaller set of EU member states. The survey asks all the standard questions on EU placement, economic and social party positioning. In terms of policy issues, the survey focuses on the key questions facing Europe in 2017 – EU economic coordination, populism, and migration. Instead of using the individual answers from experts, I am going to take the dataset that contains the mean results for each party.

## Previous analysis
On a previous analysis (see the other repo), relevant descriptive statistics were provided for this data set. Some of the most important insights obtained were: 


## Party-level conclusions
There is a positive correlation between being a more traditional/authoritarian/nationalist (TAN) party than a green/authoritarian/libertarian one and supporting a restrictive policy on immigration.
Conservative and radical TAN parties score highest on their position supporting tougher restrictions for immigration.
Greens and radical left parties, are more pro-immigration.
Parties that are identified as more right in economic terms tend to be restrictive regarding policy immigration. 
Restrictive immigration policies appear to be a general trend among European parties. 
Liberal, socialists, agrarian/center, green and regionalist parties have a strong and positive position towards the EU.Green parties seem to have larger differences between them on their support levels.
Radical TAN parties, radical left and confessional parties tend to be more anti-EU. 
There are two liberal (Partido Democrático Republicano (Portugal), Sloboda a Solidarita (Slovakia)), two regionalist (Democratic Unionist Party (UK), Lega Nord(Italy)) and one socialist party (Labour Party (UK)) that are considerably more anti-EU than the rest of the parties in their political family.
Parties that were part of the government in 2017 in their countries had on average more positive positions towards the EU than those which did not (with only two outliers).
Parties that were part of the government in 2017 were more in favor of strengthening the restrictions on immigration than those parties that were not.

## Country-level conclusions
Although in average German parties are more in favor of a strong restriction to immigration than parties in Spain, having a strong position towards immigration has a positive impact in vote shares in Spain. In the German case, being in favor of stronger restrictions has a small but negative effect on the votes obtained.
Despite their particular geographical positions, parties in Sweden and Italy have a similar position regarding immigration policies. However, in Sweden, the variance is higher, which indicates that there are parties there that are more in favor of lower restrictions to immigration than in Italy.
In Sweden a right party in economic policy terms, is not necessarily linked to strong positions regarding immigration.
In Spain, Estonia and Hungary, almost all the parties have a pro-EU position. In Estonia and Hungary there are two important outliers EKRE and Fidesz. The large spectrum covered by political parties in France, Italy and the UK might be an indication of the public opinion division regarding the EU.
In Slovakia, voters tend to look for left parties, but public opinion is inclined to strengthen the restrictions for migrants.
In Portugal, voters seem to be less radical in terms of left and right positions, and seem to have a common opinion not strenghtening meassures to migrants.
Poland’s citizens are divided between pro-EU and anti-EU, with a higher share for Pro-EU and right parties.
In italy, the vote was splitted between three parties that clustered in a not-so-radical left right position, but that differed substantially on their opinion towards the EU.
